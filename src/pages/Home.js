      <h4>
        Mitbahn is an application developped during Ironhack bootcamp 2022 in
        Berlin.
      </h4>
      Initially developped as a group project, it is now improved individually in
      order to solidify React skills. Essentially, it is a BlaBlaCar, but for 🚂 .
      It allows unrelated people to buy a group ticket, called "Quer-durchs-Land
      Ticket", making travel considerably cheaper.
